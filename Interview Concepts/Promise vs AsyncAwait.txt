Difference between Promise and Async-Await

Promise                   
• It has 3 states: pending, resolved, rejected
• Error handling is done using .then() and .catch() methods
• Promise chaining can degrade code readability and increase complexity

Async-Await
• It is state-less 
• Always returns a promise, either resolved or rejected 
• Error handling is done using .try() and .catch() methods
• Easier to implement and read the data flow .
