✅ What exactly happens when we click a URL ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ● URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is typed or clicked
     The URL is mainly made up of: Protocol, Domain name, Path
   ● Browser uses DNS (Domain Name System) to fetch the IP address of the domain name
   ● A connection is established between the browser and server
     Server is where the files and resources of a website are stored
     These files are mostly: HTML, CSS and JavaScript code
   ● Browser sends a request to view these files
   ● Server analyses the request and processes it
     It retrieves these files from its system or generates it dynamically
     And sends these files back to the browser as a response 
   ● Browser receives the HTTP response and renders the content
     First, the HTML is parsed
     Then, CSS is painted
     Finally, the JavaScript code is executed to add functionality and interactivity
   ● Browser might cache some resources to improve future page loads
