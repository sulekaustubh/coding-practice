✅ What exactly happens when we click a URL ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ● URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is typed or clicked
     The URL is mainly made up of: Protocol, Domain name, Path
   ● Browser uses DNS (Domain Name System) to fetch the IP address of the domain name
   ● A connection is established between the browser and server
     Server is where the files and resources of a website are stored
     These files are mostly: HTML, CSS and JavaScript code
   ● Browser sends a request to view these files
   ● Server analyses the request and processes it
     It retrieves these files from its system or generates it dynamically
     And sends these files back to the browser as a response 
   ● Browser receives the HTTP response and renders the content
     First, the HTML is parsed
     Then, CSS is painted
     Finally, the JavaScript code is executed to add functionality and interactivity
   ● Browser might cache some resources to improve future page loads

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ How does Browser read JSX ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ● Browsers do not understand JSX (JavaScript XML) directly
   ● Babel is a transpiler that converts JSX into regular JavaScript
   ● During conversion:
     JSX tags are converted into function calls
     These function calls create virtual representation of the DOM element
     React then uses this virtual representation to efficiently update the actual DOM

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ What is Babel ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ● It is a JavaScript compiler 
   ● Ensures that the code is compatible with a wide range of browsers
     by converting modern JavaScript code into an older version of JavaScript   
   ● Mainly used to convert JSX into regular JavaScript code

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ What is CORS ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ● CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
   ● It is a security feature implemented by web browsers
   ● It helps to control cross-origin requests to
     prevent unauthorized access to resources
   ● Without CORS, web pages could make requests to any domain,
     thus exposing sensitive data and creating security vulnerabilities
   ● CORS ensures security of a web app by 
     enforcing a same-origin policy by default
   ● When a web page in one origin tries to make an HTTP request to a different origin, 
     the browser blocks the request unless the target server explicitly allows it

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ What is Virtual DOM in React ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ● It is a virtual representation of the actual DOM
   ● It is a lightweight in-memory data structure that React 
     uses to optimize the process of updating the actual DOM
   ● It improves performance by minimizing the number of 
     direct manipulations to the real DOM  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ How does Virtual DOM actually work ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ● React maintains 2 states of the VDOM in its memory
     1. Previous state
     2. Updated state
   ● The Diffing algorithm calculates the difference between these 2 states
   ● The resultant difference is applied as a change 
     in the Real DOM in the most efficient manner
   ● This process is also known as Reconciliation

✅ Virtual DOM (VDOM)                           Real DOM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ● Virtual representation of           ● The actual Document Object Model
     the actual DOM                        representing the structure of a web page

   ● Lightweight                         ● Resource intensive          
   ● Fast                                ● Slow                 
   ● Efficient & Optimized               ● Degrades performance
                                       
   ● Cannot directly update the          ● Can update the HTML elements directly
     HTML elements                

   ● Uses Diffing algorithm and          ● Small changes can triger a complete 
     updates only those elements           re-render of the entire DOM tree 
     where a change is identified
